# coffee-machine

This is a project to practice Scala with Akka. It is based on activator-akka-scala-seed.

The package [sequential](src/main/scala/com/sequential/) has the class [CoffeeMachineSeq.scala](src/main/scala/com/sequential/CoffeeMachineSeq.scala). This class represents a sequential steps to make a Cappuccino.

The package [parallel](src/main/scala/com/parallel/) has parallel implementation of the same CoffeeMachine to make cappuccino. The class [CoffeeMachinePar.scala](src/main/scala/com/parallel/CoffeeMachinePar.scala) is the very first implementation of a parallel CoffeeMachine. This implementation only use the Future package and the Await to block the process until the cappuccino is ready.

The class [CoffeeMachinePromise.scala](src/main/scala/com/parallel/CoffeeMachinePromise.scala) shows the same CoffeeMachine but now with Promise package. Promise is a companion type that allows you to complete a Future by puting a value on it. This can be done exactly once. Once a Promise has been completed, itâ€™s not possible to change it any more.

The class [CoffeeMachinePromiseHigherOrder.scala](src/main/scala/com/parallel/CoffeeMachinePromiseHigherOrder.scala) is an evolution of the last CoffeeMachine but now with Higher-Order functions. With Higher-Order functions we can make use of the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself).

The class [CoffeeMachineActor.scala](src/main/scala/com/parallel/CoffeeMachineActor.scala) is an implementation of the CoffeeMachine using Actors from Akka package. Each job of the CoffeeMachine is using one different actor to not block the main task (make a cappuccino).


The class [CoffeeMachineActorSupervisor.scala](src/main/scala/com/parallel/supervisors/CoffeeMachineActorSupervisor.scala] and all the classes on the package [supervisors](src/main/scala/com/parallel/supervisors/) represent all actors of the CoffeeMachine with Akka. There are two main actors [CappuccinoActor](src/main/scala/com/parallel/supervisors/CappuccinoActor.scala) and [TeaActor](src/main/scala/com/parallel/supervisors/TeaActor.scala). These actors supervisors. All the other actors are Children Jobs that can fail and continue due an Exception.

The class [CoffeeMachineActorScheduler.scala](src/main/scala/com/parallel/scheduler/CoffeeMachineActorScheduler.scala) and all the classess on the package [scheduler](src/main/scala/com/parallel/scheduler/) represent all actors of the CoffeeMachine with Akka using Supervisor strategy and a scheduler. The [scheduler](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/scala/scheduler.html) fill the [WaterStorageActor.scala](src/main/scala/com/parallel/scheduler/WaterStorageActor.scala) each 3 seconds. When we ask for Tea or Cappuccino it is necessary 4 buckets of Water (unit to represent quantity). If there is no enough Water the `WaterLackException` is throwed and the [OneForOneStrategy](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/scala/fault-tolerance.html) makes a Fault Tolerance strategy to wait 1 second and ask for Water again.


The class [CoffeeMachineActorBreaks.scala](src/main/scala/com/parallel/breaks/CoffeeMachineActorBreaks.scala) and all the classes on the package [breaks](src/main/scala/com/parallel/breaks/) represent all actor of the CoffeeMachine with Akka using Supervisor with Restart and Resume strategy. The actors now have an ActoreRef on the constructor.
